Overview
========

This lesson introduces basic list and tuple construction as well as
touching upon some key list functions.

Instructions
============

The following tasks will either have you interacting with existing files in
the assignment repository or creating new ones on the fly. Don't forget to add
your interpreter directive, utf-8 encoding, and a short docstring with any new
files that you create!

.. important::

    In these exercises, you may, on occasion, come across a task that requres
    you to research or use a function or method not directly covered by the
    course text. Since Python is such a large language it would be impossible
    for the author to have included descriptions of each and every available
    function which would largely duplicate the offical Python documentation.

    A *vital* skill to successful programming is being comfortable searching
    for and using official language documentation sources like the
    `Python String Documentation`_ page. Throughout our coursework we will be
    practicing both the use of the language in practice and the search skills
    necessary to become functional programmers.

Warmup Tasks
============

Task 01
-------

In this first task, you'll be statically defining a list and a tuple using
their standard constructors.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_01.py``

2.  In ``task_01.py`` create a constant named ``ELEMENTS`` and set its values
    to a ``tuple()`` with the following data (in order):

    0.  ``None`` (the Python constant, not a string)

    1.  ``Hydrogen``

    2.  ``Helium``

    3.  ``Lithium``

    4.  ``Beryllium``

    5.  ``Boron``

    6.  ``Carbon``

3.  Create a list named ``OPERATIONS_ORDER`` and assign it the following
    data, in-order:

    0.  ``Parentheses``

    1.  ``Exponents``

    2.  ``Multiplication``

    3.  ``Division``

    4.  ``Addition``

    5.  ``Subtraction``

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> ELEMENTS
    (None, 'Hydrogen', 'Helium', 'Lithium', 'Beryllium', 'Boron', 'Carbon')
    >>> OPERATIONS_ORDER
    ['Parentheses', 'Exponents', 'Multiplication', 'Division', 'Addition',
    'Subtraction']

Task 02
-------

In this task, you'll be interacting with an existing list and performing some
standard access functions.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_02.py``.
    
2.  Import the ``data`` module that is provided as part of your repository. You
    may preview it if you wish.

3.  Make a local variable reference to ``data.BALLETS`` named ``BALLETS``.
    You will now work exclusively with your local ``BALLETS`` variable.

    .. note::

        Interestingly, since ``BALLETS`` is a mutable type passed by reference,
        any changes you make to ``BALLETS`` is also replicated in
        ``data.BALLETS`` Try printing both in your interpreter window to
        see mutability at work!

    .. note::

        Since Python passes mutable types by reference upon assignment it would
        be improper to say *make a local copy of data.BALLETS* even if
        that's what might it might feel like. Either way, the construction is
        similar and uses the assignment operator `` = `` just that mutable
        types are passed by reference.

4.  Modify ``BALLETS`` and use the ``del`` statement to remove the item at the
    index 11 position.

5.  Next, using a slice-style syntax (eg, ``VAR[x]``), change the value of the
    second item on the ``BALLETS`` list to ``Swan Lake``

6.  Now, append a new item to the ``BALLETS`` list. Use the ``append()`` method
    to add a new item with a value of ``'Herman Schmerman'``

7.  Finally, use the ``extend()`` function to add two more items to the list in
    a single statement:

    1.  Don Quixote
            
    2.  Sylvia

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_02
    >>> len(task_02.BALLETS)
    24
    

Task 03
-------

While tuples are immutable entities you can still "add" or "delete" elements
by creating new tuples and using slice syntax and arithmetic operators. Here,
we'll practice it.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_03.py``.

2.  Import the ``data`` module that is provided as part of your repository. You
    may preview it if you wish.

3.  Create a local copy of ``data.DIRECTIONS`` named ``DIRECTIONS``

4.  Using a combination of slice syntax (``var[x]``) and arithmetic operators,
    replace the last item of ``DIRECTIONS`` with the value ``West`` saving the
    resultant new tuple back into the ``DIRECTIONS`` variable.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> import task_03
    >>> task_03.DIRECTIONS
    ('North', 'South', 'East', 'West')

Task 04
-------

Looping lists with a ``for`` loop is a powerful and straightforward way to
process huge blocks of data at the same time. Here, we'll explore this concept
with our ``data`` module.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a new module named ``task_04.py``.
    
2.  Create a new function named ``process_data()`` that takes one argument:

    1.  ``data``, a list or tuple of numbers.

3.  Use a ``for`` loop to loop through the data and return a tuple
    containing the follow data points in-order:

    1.  The total sum of the data

    2.  The average of the data with floating point precision

.. hint::

    Avoid repetition at all costs and remember that repetition inside of a
    loop is still repetition even if the code itself is not repeated.

.. hint::

    You should first create your total outside of the loop so you can add to
    it as the loop is processing.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> process_data([1, 2, 3])
    (6, 2.0)

.. tip::

    Check out the ``data`` module for a few functions that return a huge

    number of records and watch your

Task 05
-------

Our last warmup task will touch upon the mutability differences between
strings and their cousin, the tuple.

Specifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.  Create a module named ``task_05.py``

2.  Create a function named ``flip_keys()`` that takes one argument:

    1.  A list named ``to_flip``. This list is assumed to have nested,
        immutable sequences inside it, eg: ``[(1, 2, 3), 'hello']``

3.  Use a ``for`` loop to loop the list and reverse the order of the
    inner sequence. All operations on the outer list must operate on the
    original object, taking advantage of its mutability. Inner elements are
    immutable and will require replacement.

4.  The function should return the original list with its inner elements
    reversed.

.. hint::

    In order to change the value in ``to_flip`` you'll need some way to know
    which index you're attempting to change. To do-this, create a variable
    to act as a counter and increment it within your loop, eg:

    .. code:: python

        counter = 0
        for value in iterable_object:
        # do something
        counter += 1

.. hint::

    For an idea on how to reverse a tuple, head back to an earlier assignment
    when you reversed a string using the slice syntax.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code:: pycon

    >>> LIST = [(1, 2, 3), 'abc']
    >>> NEW = flip_keys(LIST)
    >>> LIST is NEW
    True
    >>> print LIST
    [(3, 2, 1), 'cba']

Executing Tests
===============

Code must be functional and pass tests before it will be eligible for credit.

Linting
-------

Lint tests check your code for syntactic or stylistic errors To execute lint
tests against a specific file, simply open a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ pylint filename.py

Where ``filename.py`` is the name of the file you wish to lint test.

Unit Tests
----------

Unit tests check that your code performs the tested objectives. Unit tests
may be executed individually by opening a terminal in the same directory as
your code repository and typing:

.. code:: console

    $ nosetests tests/name_of_test.py

Where ``name_of_test.py`` is the name of the testfile found in the ``tests``
directory of your source code.

Running All Tests
-----------------

All tests may be run simultaneously by executing the ``runtests.sh`` script
from the root of your assignment repository. To execute all tests, open a
terminal in the same directory as your code repository and type:

.. code:: console

    $ bash runtests.sh

Submission
==========

Code should be submitted to `GitHub`_ by means of opening a pull request.

As-of Lesson 02, each student will have a branch named after his or her
`GitHub`_ username. Pull requests should be made against the branch that
matches your `GitHub`_ username. Pull requests made against other branches will
be closed.  This work flow mimics the steps you took to open a pull request
against the ``pull`` branch in Week Two.

For a refresher on how to open a pull request, please see homework instructions
in Lesson 01. It is recommended that you run PyLint locally after each file
is edited in order to reduce the number of errors found in testing.

In order to receive full credit you must complete the assignment as-instructed
and without any violations (reported in the build status). There will be
automated tests for this assignment to provide early feedback on program code.

When you have completed this assignment, please post the link to your
pull request in the body of the assignment on Blackboard in order to receive
credit.
